        self.regimes = ['trending_up', 'trending_down', 'ranging', 'volatile']
    
    def detect_regime(self, df, symbol='SPY'):
        """Detect current market regime"""
        # ADX for trend strength
        adx = self.calculate_adx(df)
        
        # ATR for volatility
        atr_ratio = self.calculate_atr_ratio(df)
        
        # Moving average alignment
        ma_alignment = self.check_ma_alignment(df)
        
        # Classify regime
        if adx > 25 and ma_alignment == 'bullish':
            return 'trending_up'
        elif adx > 25 and ma_alignment == 'bearish':
            return 'trending_down'
        elif atr_ratio > 1.5:
