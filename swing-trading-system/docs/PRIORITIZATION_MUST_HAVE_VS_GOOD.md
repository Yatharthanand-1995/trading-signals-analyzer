- **Impact**: Improves win rate from 55% to 65%+
- **Example**: RSI divergence catches exact tops/bottoms
- **Implementation Time**: 2-3 days

### 3. **Intraday Data for Entry Timing** (Quick Win)
- **Why Critical**: Better entries = larger profits on same move
- **Impact**: 0.5-1% better entry can mean 25-50% more profit
- **Example**: Enter at intraday support vs daily close
- **Implementation Time**: 2-3 days

### 4. **Real-Time Monitoring** (Phase 4.2)
- **Why Critical**: Swing trades need active management
